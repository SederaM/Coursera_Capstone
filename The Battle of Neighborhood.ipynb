Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Zumba Fitness Club** in **New York**, The United-States.\n\nSince there are lots of Fitness Club in New York we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with gymnasium**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Afro Zumba Fitness Club in vicinity**. We would also prefer neighborhoods **with high percentage of Black or Hispanic population**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
